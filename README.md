## My process

I started by analyzing the design in Figma to understand the layout and spacing requirements.  
I decided to build the project using HTML and CSS, focusing on responsive design using flexbox.  

I used Google Fonts to import the Outfit font and followed the style guide for font sizes, weights, and colors.  
I encountered challenges with spacing between elements, which I solved using flex gap and proper padding.

This project helped me improve my understanding of CSS flexbox and responsive design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
